	computers and technology, but I only got into programming in 2020 at the age
	of 16. I started with <span class="about-csharp">C#</span> and then moved on
	to exploring other languages and technologies. I eventually found my way to
	<span class="about-rust">Rust</span>, which I now use for most of my projects.

	<span class="about-constructor">Constructor University</span>,

	also love tutoring Mathematics and Computer Scinece.
	<h3>Future</h3>
	I'm excited about the future of technology and the countless problems it will
	solve for humanity. With my skills and passion, I'm confident that I can make
	meaningful contributions to my field.
